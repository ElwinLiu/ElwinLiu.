To perform a great sharing, please follow the below practices.

- Do not share a big topic, small is better, less is more.
- While preparing for the sharing contents, you're encouraged to discuss with seniors, who could provide whole picture, things you don't know and more systematic way of thinking in a certain area.
- Outlines
  - What's the problem
  - Possible solutions?
  - The best practice?
  - The mechanism, key techniques, and source code?
  - Pros & Cons?
  - Further reading list or References?
